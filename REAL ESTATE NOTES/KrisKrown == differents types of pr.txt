KrisKrown ==> differents types of properties pros and cons

AS an investor, we need to focus more on the return of investment ROI before choosing the types of investment

4 DIFFERENTS TYPES OF REI

- single-family homes
. pros: little turnover, appreciates in value, low cost to manage
. cons: market controls the rent, no economies of scale

- multifamily is a residential property that has more than one housing unit such as apt complexes and condominiums.
. pros: can add value throuh amenities, much faster to scale, easy to finance 
. cons: more expensive, competitive market, tougher to manage

- short-term rental (Airbnb)
. pros: 3-4times the income of long term rental, can be reserved for personal use, high demand
. cons: comes with fees, requires time and management, can gave unruly guests

- commercial property
. pros: rent is not condition by the market, must negociate with each client, lowest maintenance, longest leases
. cons: every property is different and requires specialized knowledge, large initial investment

NB: single family is the best because you can automate the process for consistent ROI. that means you can implement a system that you can repeat over again and get a predictable result.
